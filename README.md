## What is RNode?

RNode is a decentralized, economic, censorship-resistant, public compute infrastructure and blockchain developed by F1R3FLY.io. It implements **four distinct consensus mechanisms** using the Rholang programming language:

1. **Cordial Miners** - Cooperative, energy-efficient mining approach
2. **Casper CBC** - Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus with mathematical safety proofs
3. **RGB Partially Synchronized State Machines** - Client-side validation with Bitcoin L1 anchoring
4. **Casanova** - Adaptive consensus for high-performance scenarios

The platform hosts and executes smart contracts written in Rholang, providing trustworthy, scalable, concurrent transaction processing with multi-consensus flexibility and Bitcoin anchoring for additional security.

### Key Features
- **Multi-Consensus Architecture**: Four consensus mechanisms for different use cases
- **Concurrent Execution**: Built on ρ-calculus for true parallel smart contract execution
- **Sharded Design**: Scalable architecture with cross-shard communication
- **Bitcoin Anchoring**: Layer 1 security through RGB protocol integration
- **Developer-Friendly**: Comprehensive CLI tools and development environment

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Nix**: https://nixos.org/download/
   - For more information about Nix and how it works see: https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works/

2. **Install direnv**: https://direnv.net/#basic-installation
   - For more information about direnv and how it works see: https://direnv.net/

3. **Clone and Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/F1R3FLY-io/rnode.git
   cd rnode
   direnv allow
   ```
   
   If you encounter the error: `error: experimental Nix feature 'nix-command' is disabled`:
   - Create the file: `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`
   - Add the line: `experimental-features = flakes nix-command`
   - Run `direnv allow` again

### Docker

```bash
docker pull f1r3flyindustries/rnode-rust-node
```

See https://hub.docker.com/r/f1r3flyindustries/rnode-rust-node for more information.

### Platform Packages

- **Debian/Ubuntu**: Coming Soon
- **RedHat/Fedora**: Coming Soon
- **macOS**: Coming Soon

## Building

Prerequisites: [Environment set up](#installation).

```bash
# Compile and create Docker image
docker context use default && sbt ";compile ;project node ;Docker/publishLocal ;project rchain"

# Compile and create fat jar (for local execution)
sbt ";compile ;project node ;assembly ;project rchain"

# Clean the project
sbt "clean"
```

It is recommended to have a terminal window open just for `sbt` to run various commands.

## Running

### Docker

```bash
# Start a shard
docker compose -f docker/shard.yml up

# Delete data directory for fresh start (performs genesis ceremony)
./scripts/delete_data.sh
```

### Local

```bash
# Run standalone node locally
java -Djna.library.path=./rust_libraries/release \
  --add-opens java.base/sun.security.util=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED \
  -jar node/target/scala-2.12/rnode-assembly-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar run \
  -s --no-upnp --allow-private-addresses --synchrony-constraint-threshold=0.0

# Delete data directory for fresh start
rm -rf ~/.rnode/
```

## Usage

### Node CLI

A command-line interface for interacting with RNode is available in the `node-cli` directory. Features include:

- **Deploying** Rholang code to RNode
- **Proposing** blocks to create a new block containing deployed code
- **Full Deploy** operations (deploy + propose in one step)
- **Checking finalization** of blocks with automatic retries
- **Exploratory Deploy** to execute Rholang without committing to the blockchain
- **Generating Public Keys** from private keys
- **Generating Key Pairs** for creating new blockchain identities

For detailed usage instructions, see the [Node CLI README](node-cli/README.md).

### Evaluating Rholang Contracts

```bash
# Build node executable
sbt ";compile ;stage"

# Evaluate a contract
./node/target/universal/stage/bin/rnode \
  -Djna.library.path=./rust_libraries/release \
  eval ./rholang/examples/tut-ai.rho
```

### RNodeFS

Check out [RNodeFS](https://github.com/F1R3FLY-io/rnodefs#rnodefs) for a simple, easy-to-use, and fast file system built on top of RNode.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all Rust tests
./scripts/run_rust_tests.sh

# Run Scala tests
sbt test

# Run specific test suites
sbt "project node" test
sbt "project rspace" test

# Coverage report (when available)
sbt coverage test coverageReport
```

## 🚢 Deployment

See [deployment documentation](docs/deployment) for detailed deployment instructions.

## Configuration

Most command line options can be specified in a configuration file. The default location is the data directory. An alternative location can be specified with `--config-file <path>`.

The format is [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md). See [defaults.conf](node/src/main/resources/defaults.conf) for all options and default values.

Example configuration:
```hocon
standalone = false

protocol-server {
  network-id = "testnet"
  port = 40400
}

protocol-client {
  network-id = "testnet"
  bootstrap = "rnode://de6eed5d00cf080fc587eeb412cb31a75fd10358@52.119.8.109?protocol=40400&discovery=40404"
}

api-server {
  host = "my-rnode.domain.com"
  port-grpc-external = 40401
  port-grpc-internal = 40402
  port-http = 40403
  port-admin-http = 40405
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**General nix problems or unable to load `flake.nix`:**
```bash
nix-garbage-collect
```

**SBT build problems:**
```bash
rm -rf ~/.cache/coursier/
sbt clean
```

**StackOverflow error from node compile:**
```bash
sbt "node/compile"
```

**Rust problems:**
```bash
./scripts/clean_rust_libraries.sh
rustup default stable
```
