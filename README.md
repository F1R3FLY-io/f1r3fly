## What is this project?
[![Build Status](https://github.com/rchain/rchain/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rchain/rchain/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Astaging)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/rchain/rchain/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/rchain/rchain)

The open-source F1r3fly project is building a decentralized, economic,
censorship-resistant, public compute infrastructure and blockchain. It will
host and execute programs popularly referred to as “smart contracts”. It will
be trustworthy, scalable, concurrent, with proof-of-stake consensus and
content delivery.

[F1r3fly Developer](https://developer.rchain.coop/) features project-related
tutorials and documentation, project planning information, events calendar,
and information for how to engage with this project.

## Note on the use of this software
This code has not yet completed a security review. We strongly recommend that you do not use it in production or to transfer items of material value. We take no responsibility for any loss you may incur through the use of this code.

## Use the public testnet
The F1r3fly Cooperative maintains a public testnet running the latest version of RNode. Learn more at [F1r3fly public testnet information](https://rchain.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CORE/pages/678756429/RChain+public+testnet+information).

## How 
## Installation

### Docker

`$ docker pull rchain/rnode:latest`

### Debian/Ubuntu

1. Download a `.deb` package from the [releases page](https://github.com/rchain/rchain/releases/)
2. `$ sudo apt install ./rnode_<VERSION>.deb`, where `<VERSION>` is something like `0.9.18`

### RedHat/Fedora

1. Download a `.rpm` package from the [releases page](https://github.com/rchain/rchain/releases/)
2. `$ sudo rpm -U ./rnode_<VERSION>.noarch.rpm`, where `<VERSION>` is something like `0.9.18`

### macOS

1. Install Homebrew by following steps at the [Homebrew homepage](https://brew.sh/)
2. `$ brew install rchain/rchain/rnode`

## Running

Docker will be used in the examples port portability reasons, but running the
node as a standalone process is very similar.

To fetch the latest version of RNode from the remote Docker hub and run it (exit with `C-c`):

```sh
$ docker run -it -p 40400:40400 rchain/rnode:latest

# With binding of RNode data directory to the host directory $HOME/rnode 
$ docker run -v $HOME/rnode:/var/lib/rnode -it -p 40400:40400 rchain/rnode:latest
```

In order to use both the peer-to-peer network and REPL capabilities of the
node, you need to run more than one Docker RNode on the same host, the
containers need to be connected to one user-defined network bridge:

```bash
$ docker network create rnode-net

$ docker run -dit --name rnode0 --network rnode-net rchain/rnode:latest run -s

$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
ef770b4d4139   rchain/rnode:latest   "bin/rnode --profile…"   23 seconds ago   Up 22 seconds             rnode0
```

To attach terminal to RNode logstream execute

```bash
$ docker logs -f rnode0
[...]
08:38:11.460 [main] INFO  logger - Listening for traffic on rnode://137200d47b8bb0fff54a753aabddf9ee2bfea089@172.18.0.2?protocol=40400&discovery=40404
[...]
```

A repl instance can be invoked in a separate terminal using the following command:

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm --name rnode-repl --network rnode-net rchain/rnode:latest --grpc-host rnode0 --grpc-port 40402 repl

  ╦═╗┌─┐┬ ┬┌─┐┬┌┐┌  ╔╗╔┌─┐┌┬┐┌─┐  ╦═╗╔═╗╔═╗╦  
  ╠╦╝│  ├─┤├─┤││││  ║║║│ │ ││├┤   ╠╦╝║╣ ╠═╝║  
  ╩╚═└─┘┴ ┴┴ ┴┴┘└┘  ╝╚╝└─┘─┴┘└─┘  ╩╚═╚═╝╩  ╩═╝
    
rholang $
```

Type `@42!("Hello!")` in REPL console. This command should result in (`rnode0` output):
```bash
Evaluating:
@{42}!("Hello!")
```

A peer node can be started with the following command (note that `--bootstrap` takes the listening address of `rnode0`):

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm --name rnode1 --network rnode-net rchain/rnode:latest run --bootstrap 'rnode://8c775b2143b731a225f039838998ef0fac34ba25@rnode0?protocol=40400&discovery=40404' --allow-private-addresses --host rnode1

```

The above command should result in (`rnode0` output):
```bash

```

To get a full list of options rnode accepts, use the `--help` option:

```sh
$ docker run -it --rm rchain/rnode:latest --help
```

### Configuration file

Most of the command line options can be specified in a configuration file.

The default location of the configuration file is the data directory. An
alternative location can be specified with the command line option `--config-file <path>`.

The format of the configuration file is [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md).

The [defaults.conf](node/src/main/resources/defaults.conf) configuration file shows all options and default values.

Example configuration file:

```yml
standalone = false

protocol-server {
  network-id = "testnet"
  port = 40400
}

protocol-client {
  network-id = "testnet"
  bootstrap = "rnode://de6eed5d00cf080fc587eeb412cb31a75fd10358@52.119.8.109?protocol=40400&discovery=40404"
}

peers-discovery {
  port = 40404
}

api-server {
  host = "my-rnode.domain.com"
  port-grpc-external = 40401
  port-grpc-internal = 40402
  port-http = 40403
  port-admin-http = 40405
}

storage {
  data-dir = "/my-data-dir"
}

casper {
  fault-tolerance-threshold = 1
  shard-name = root
  finalization-rate = 1
}

metrics {
  prometheus = false
  influxdb = false
  influxdb-udp = false
  zipkin = false
  sigar = false
}

dev-mode = false
```

## Development

Compile the project with:

```bash
$ sbt clean compile

# With executable and Docker image
$ sbt clean compile stage docker:publishLocal
```

Run the resulting binary with:

```bash
$ ./node/target/universal/stage/bin/rnode
```

For more detailed instructions, see the [developer guide](DEVELOPER.md).
