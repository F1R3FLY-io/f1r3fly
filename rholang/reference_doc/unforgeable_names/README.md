## Unforgeable names

This whole chapter essentially talks about the `NameDeclaration` syntactic category.

- Channels you send/receive on can only be over unforgeable names
- The way they're parsed: they're quoted unforgeable processes, so you *can* evaluate them, etc.
- Unforgeable names can be shared by sending `* unforgeable_name` over a channel.
- Unforgeable names are generated by a random number generator (Blake 512-b).
  - Mike: I think based on a tree hashing algorithm (see Blake 512-b)
  - Mike: The seed is the timestamp and user id.
  - Kyle: "seeded with the deploy proto stripped of all fields except timestamp and user id"
  - Kyle: "it's a custom mode of Blake2"

## Name Registry
Describes the `NameVariable( Uri )`

Examples of some name registries and what they're used for
- Std out
  - Things sent over that channel are sent to std out
