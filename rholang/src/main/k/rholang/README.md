# Rholang K-Framework

The Rholang K-Framework is currently unfinished, but well on its way to a beautiful, coherent set
of semantics.

Work on the K-Framework was recently moved to a [different repository](https://github.com/MrChico/krho)
for CI purposes. It's been completely revamped from this one, making use of a structural type
system. That is the most recent version of the K-Framework.

[I've published a complete view of how I think the semantics should go](https://github.com/differentialderek/rholang),
 but did not have time to implement it fully. Treat this as sort of a brain dump. Here you can find
 the exposition of the structural type system and some guidance for future work.

 Please do not hesitate to reach out to me with questions on the RChain Discord at `@Derek` or at
 derek AT pyrofex DOT net.
