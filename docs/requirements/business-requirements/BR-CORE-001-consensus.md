# Business Requirement: Multi-Consensus Architecture

## Requirement ID
BR-CORE-001

## Summary
RNode shall implement four distinct consensus mechanisms using Rholang: Cordial Miners, Casper, RGB Partially Synchronized State Machines, and Casanova. This multi-consensus approach enables different consensus models for different use cases and network conditions.

## Business Rationale
Different consensus mechanisms excel in different scenarios. By implementing multiple approaches, RNode can:
- Optimize for different performance and security tradeoffs
- Support various network topologies and trust models
- Enable experimentation with novel consensus approaches
- Provide fallback mechanisms for network resilience

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Cordial Miners
- Cooperative mining approach with reduced competition
- Energy-efficient consensus for sustainable operations
- Collaborative block production with shared rewards
- Incentive alignment for network cooperation

### 2. Casper CBC (Correct by Construction)
- Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus with mathematical safety proofs
- Asynchronous network assumptions
- Economic finality through proof-of-stake
- Validator bonding and slashing mechanisms
- Fork choice rule based on GHOST protocol

### 3. RGB Partially Synchronized State Machines
- Client-side validation with off-chain state transitions
- Bitcoin-anchored state commitments
- Scalable smart contract execution
- Privacy-preserving state updates
- Reduced on-chain footprint

### 4. Casanova
- Novel consensus mechanism for high-throughput scenarios
- Optimized for concurrent transaction processing
- Dynamic consensus adaptation based on network conditions
- Advanced finality guarantees

### 5. Implementation Requirements
- All consensus mechanisms implemented in Rholang
- Pluggable consensus architecture
- Runtime consensus switching capability
- Cross-consensus communication protocols

## Success Criteria
- Each consensus mechanism operates according to its specifications
- Smooth transitions between consensus mechanisms when required
- No loss of network integrity during consensus switches
- Performance optimization for each use case scenario
- Successful validation of all consensus implementations

## Dependencies
- Validator bonding mechanism
- P2P networking layer
- Block storage and retrieval
- Cryptographic primitives
