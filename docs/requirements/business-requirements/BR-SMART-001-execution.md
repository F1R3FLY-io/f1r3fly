# Business Requirement: Smart Contract Execution Model

## Requirement ID
BR-SMART-001

## Summary
RNode shall provide a concurrent smart contract execution environment using the Rholang language and RSpace storage model, enabling parallel processing of non-conflicting transactions.

## Business Rationale
Traditional blockchain platforms suffer from sequential transaction processing bottlenecks. RNode's concurrent execution model enables:
- Higher transaction throughput
- Better resource utilization
- Scalable smart contract platform
- Deterministic parallel execution

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Rholang Language Support
- Full implementation of Rholang syntax and semantics
- Pattern matching on channel communications
- Name unforgability for security
- Process calculus based execution model
- Behavioral types for contract verification

### 2. RSpace Storage Model
- Tuple space for storing data and continuations
- Content-addressed storage with path dependencies
- LMDB backend for persistence
- Checkpoint and rollback capabilities
- Efficient garbage collection

### 3. Concurrent Execution
- Parallel execution of non-conflicting transactions
- Deterministic replay for consensus
- Cost accounting for all operations
- Resource limits per transaction
- Isolation between contract executions

### 4. Cost Model
- Phlogiston (gas) based resource accounting
- Predictable costs for all operations
- Configurable price per operation
- Protection against resource exhaustion
- Fair scheduling of contract execution

## Success Criteria
- Contracts execute deterministically across all nodes
- Parallel execution improves throughput by >10x
- Gas costs are predictable and reasonable
- No contract can exhaust node resources

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain deterministic execution
- Replay must produce identical results
- Cost accounting must be precise
- Storage must be efficiently garbage collected

## Dependencies
- Rholang interpreter implementation
- RSpace storage layer
- Cost accounting system
- Transaction validation
