# User Story: Node Operator Experience

## Story
As a node operator, I want to easily deploy and manage an RNode instance so that I can participate in the network as a validator or observer.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] I can install RNode using standard package managers (apt, yum, brew)

- [ ] I can start/stop/restart my node using standard system commands
- [ ] I can monitor my node's health and performance through logs and metrics
- [ ] I can easily upgrade my node to new versions
- [ ] I can configure my node as either a validator or observer
- [ ] I can manage my validator bond and rewards

## Technical Requirements
- Support for multiple operating systems (Linux, macOS)
- Docker container support for easy deployment
- Systemd service integration on Linux
- Clear documentation for configuration options
- Automated health checks and recovery mechanisms

## Dependencies
- Nix/Direnv development environment
- Docker containerization
- System service managers (systemd, launchd)
