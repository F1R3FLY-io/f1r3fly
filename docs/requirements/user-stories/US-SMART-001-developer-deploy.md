# User Story: Smart Contract Developer Deployment

## Story
As a smart contract developer, I want to deploy and interact with Rholang contracts on RNode so that I can build decentralized applications.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] I can write contracts in Rholang with clear syntax and semantics
- [ ] I can deploy contracts using the node CLI with simple commands
- [ ] I can estimate the cost (phlogiston) of my contract execution
- [ ] I can query contract state and results
- [ ] I can test contracts locally before mainnet deployment
- [ ] I receive clear error messages when contracts fail
- [ ] I can monitor contract execution and gas consumption

## Technical Requirements
- Rholang interpreter with full language support
- CLI tools for contract deployment and interaction
- Local development environment with REPL
- Gas estimation capabilities
- Contract debugging and tracing tools

## Example Workflow
```bash
# Deploy a contract
cargo run -- deploy -f my_contract.rho --private-key $MY_KEY

# Propose a block
cargo run -- propose

# Check finalization
cargo run -- is-finalized -b $BLOCK_HASH

# Query contract state
cargo run -- exploratory-deploy -f query.rho
```

## Dependencies
- Rholang language implementation
- RSpace state storage
- node-cli tools
- Gas accounting system
