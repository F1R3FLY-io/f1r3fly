# SHARED RNODE CONFIGURATION - FOR RUNTIME-JOINING VALIDATORS
# =================================================================
# This configuration is used by VALIDATORS JOINING AN EXISTING NETWORK
# 
# ROLE: Runtime Validators (join existing network after genesis)
# - Validates transactions and creates blocks after bonding
# - Does NOT participate in genesis ceremony (network already exists)
# - Connects to bootstrap node to join the existing network

# - genesis-validator-mode = false (joins existing network, not genesis ceremony)
# - ceremony-master-mode = false (does NOT coordinate any ceremony)
# - Uses --bootstrap flag to connect to existing network
# - Does NOT use --genesis-validator command line flag
#
# USED BY: validator4 and other runtime-joining validators
# NOT USED BY: genesis validators (validator1-3) or bootstrap
